      <h1>First steps</h1>
      <p>If you do not know where you are and do not detect any signs of nearby people it is advisable that you stay where you are.</p>
      <p>Travelling further will likely result in you getting more lost and it will make it more difficult for the search parties to locate you.</p>
      <p>If it’s getting late and you have no idea where you are it’s advisable that you begin to think about what you are going to do for the night.</p>
      <p>Temperatures can drop quickly at night and you don’t want to be out in the open.</p>

      <h1>Rule of threes</h1>
      <p>When creating a long term survival plan the first thing you have to know is the “rule of threes” which states that you can survive:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Three minutes without oxygen</li>
        <li>Three hours in an extreme environment (heat or cold)</li>
        <li>Three days without water</li>
        <li>Three weeks without food</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The key to wilderness survival is prioritizing. You most likely won’t have to worry about oxygen, so for now your priorities are shelter, water, and food.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="hidden">
      <h1>Shelters</h1>
      <p>A shelter is vital if you wish to be somewhat comfortable at night. Building a shelter will also give you something to do, it is important to keep yourself occupied.</p>
      <p>First you’ll want to find a location. A nice dry flat area that is readily visible to anyone who might be looking for you is preferable. The easiest shelter to make is an A-Frame to make a A-Frame first you must find a long sturdy branch and prop it up against a lot. Then lean shorter branches against the main branch. Now cover the frame with leaves and branches. </p>
