          </ul>

      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="hidden">
      <h1>First steps</h1>
      <p>If you do not know where you are and do not detect any signs of nearby people it is advisable that you stay where you are.</p>
      <p>Travelling further will likely result in you getting more lost and it will make it more difficult for the search parties to locate you.</p>
      <p>If it’s getting late and you have no idea where you are it’s advisable that you begin to think about what you are going to do for the night.</p>
      <p>Temperatures can drop quickly at night and you don’t want to be out in the open.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="hidden">
      <h1>Rule of threes</h1>
      <p>When creating a long term survival plan the first thing you have to know is the “rule of threes” which states that you can survive:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Three minutes without oxygen</li>
        <li>Three hours in an extreme environment (heat or cold)</li>
        <li>Three days without water</li>
        <li>Three weeks without food</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The key to wilderness survival is prioritizing. You most likely won’t have to worry about oxygen, so for now your priorities are shelter, water, and food.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="hidden">
      <h1>Shelters</h1>
      <p>A shelter is vital if you wish to be somewhat comfortable at night. Building a shelter will also give you something to do, it is important to keep yourself occupied.</p>
      <p>First you’ll want to find a location. A nice dry flat area that is readily visible to anyone who might be looking for you is preferable. The easiest shelter to make is an A-Frame to make a A-Frame first you must find a long sturdy branch and prop it up against a lot. Then lean shorter branches against the main branch. Now cover the frame with leaves and branches. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="hidden">
      <p style = "text-align:center;"><img src="img/shelter.png"></p>
      <p>Ideally your shelter should be no more than three feet tall and as long as your body length to conserve heat. </p>
    </div>

    <div class = "hidden">
      <h1>Water</h1>
      <p>If you want to survive longer than three days you will need to find a source of clean water. The easiest way to access clean drinking water is to collect rainwater, but this isn’t always possible.</p>
      <p>You should always carry water purification tablets when you go out hiking, they are a cheap and lightweight way to clean water effectively.</p>
    </div>

    <div class = "hidden">
      <br><br><br>
      <p>If you don't have a receptacle:</p>
      <p>A last resort method to make water a bit safer to drink is to run it through fabric such as a shirt or bandana. Unfortunately this will not remove harmful microbes.</p>
      <p>Drinking water in the wilderness is always a calculated risk. Somewhat dirty water is often better than no water if you have been out for days.</p>
    </div>

    <div class = "hidden">
      <h1>Food</h1>
      <p>The average human can survive for over three weeks without food. This means that finding food is not your priority.</p>
      <p>Another important thing to consider is that a lot what looks like food in the wilderness can actually be quite harmful. Foraging for food should be a last resort, especially if you are not familiar with what’s edible in your region.</p>
      <p>The following few pages will briefly go over what is and isn’t edible in the woods of southern Ontario.</p>
    </div>

    <div class = "hidden">
      <h1>Insects and other creepy crawlies</h1>
      <p>Generally speaking, most insects (six legs) are fine to eat. However, you should avoid other creepy crawlies such as spiders and centipedes. You should also avoid anything that is brightly coloured or hairy.</p>
      <p><img src = "img/Worm.png" height="90px" width = "90px" style="padding: 0 2em; float: left"><br>Earthworm (<i>Lumbricus terrestris</i>) &nbsp &nbsp <font color="green">Safe</font></p>

    </div>

    <div class = "hidden">
      <h1>Mushrooms</h1>
      <p>Do not eat a mushroom unless you are 100% sure it is safe. There are many poisonous mushrooms that look very similar to edible ones.</p>
      <p><img src = "img/Chanterelle.png" height="90px" width = "90px"style="padding: 0 2em; float: left"><br> Chanterelle (<i>Cantharellus</i>) &nbsp &nbsp <font color="green">Safe</font></p>

     </div>

     <div class = "hidden">
       <br><br><br>
       <p><img src = "img/King Bolete.png" height="90px" width = "90px"style="padding: 0 2em; float: left"><br>King Bolete (<i>Boletus edulis</i>) &nbsp &nbsp <font color="green">Safe</font></p><br><br>
       <p>There are thousands of species of fungi in Ontario, so chances are that the potential food item you've found is not in this guide. No guide to fungi in Ontario is complete, so if you come across a mushroom and are not 100% sure it is exactly the same as the one in the guide don't eat it.</p>
       <p>If a poisonous substance has been ingested there isn't much to do except spit it out and drink lots of water to try to dilute it. So it's best to avoid anything that could be poisonous.</p>
     </div>

    <div class = "hidden">
      <h1>Plants</h1>
      <p>As with mushrooms, do not eat a plant that you cannot identify.</p>
