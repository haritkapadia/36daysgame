# Word of Warning

The advice in the game is based off of legitimate research and in theory should hold true in a survival situation. But, circumstances differ and this year's peer-reviewed research may be next year's old wives tale. Therefore, we advise that you do not try any of the survival techniques taught in this game unless absolutely necessary, and we are not responsible for any injuries, illness or death that may ensue.
